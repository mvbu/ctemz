#summary Information about the input parameter file, and output files produced by {{{ctemz}}}.

= Input file {{{temzinp.txt}}} =

This file is read in right at the start of execution and contains the runtime values for various simulation parameters. Here is the file as currently checked in (Feb 2014), with some comments added:

(TODO: need to describe *all* the parameters above)

=Output Files=

The output files are as follows:
  * {{{ctemzlc.txt}}} Light curve at each time step
  * {{{ctemzspec.txt}}} Spectrum at each time step, for 68 frequencies
  * {{{ctemzpol.txt}}} Polarization values for each time step
  * {{{maps/ctemzmap[xxxx].txt}}} "Map" files used to create diagrams (TODO: not sure exactly what they do. Prof. Marscher would know)
